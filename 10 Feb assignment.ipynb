    "open() together? '''\n",
    "\"\"\"The with statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code with methods defined by a context manager. When used with the open() function, the with statement helps to ensure that the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed, even if an error occurs during execution. This is because the with statement automatically takes care of closing the file, whereas if the open() function is used without with, it is the responsibility of the programmer to manually close the file after use, which can be error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using the with statement and open() together is that it helps to avoid common programming errors related to file handling. For example, forgetting to close a file can cause issues such as data loss or file corruption, especially in large programs where file handling is complex. By using the with statement, you don't have to worry about closing the file manually, and the file is guaranteed to be closed properly, even if an exception is raised during execution.\n",
